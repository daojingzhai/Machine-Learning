# Machine-Learning
### _“ History never repeats itself but it rhymes”_
### _---Mark Twain_

Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn". Rich historical data and smart algorithms bring great prediction power to "machine". In this repository, I reserve my projects material and course material in my Intro to Machine Learning and Data Mining courses.
